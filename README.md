Project Discription : 
  The project aims to train different models on a unique stress detection dataset for nurses in a hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak. The dataset includes physiological variables such as electrodermal activity, Heart Rate, and skin temperature, as well as a periodic smartphone-administered survey that captured the contributing factors for the detected stress events.
 
  This project aims to evaluate the performance of different machine learning models for predicting stress levels based on recorded physiological signals. The project also examines which physiological signals are most relevant for detecting stress and provides recommendations for improving the accuracy and reliability of stress detection using wearable technology.
